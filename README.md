LeapMotionMouse
===============

This java program gives gesture based mouse control using Leap Motion.

Using classes found in the SDK, it runs an infinite while loop that looks for specific gestures
and controls the mouse onscreen accordingly.

Gestures:
Move mouse - Point one finger at desired location
Click mouse - Move finger towards screen until it locks in place, then move closer to click
Right click - Extend a second finger (or thumb which is physically easier) while mouse is locked
Scroll - Extend 2+ fingers and move hand up/down
Click and drag - Lift a second hand to grab with mouse, move it away to release
